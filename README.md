Question of Interest:
Which variables are associated with USA's COVID19 total cases.

CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) is one of the most severe communicable disease from the entire human history. It spread out to More than 200 countries and more than 20,000,000 people are infected until 2020 August 6th and counting.

COVID-19 starts from Wuhan, China and it spread out to nearby countries rapidly. After that, several infectees move to Italy, so entire Europe starts to having a lot of COVID19 patients.

However, the biggest issue is USA. After Europe's infection(especially Italy), COVID19 starts to move South, and North America. 
As a result, more than 5,000,000 cases are occurred in USA which is almost 25% of total cases. (followed by data until 2020 August 6th)
At this point, I wonder that which variables are associated most with USA's COVID-19 total cases.

I used data from https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#demographics
I did not consider the Death rate or Death count from USA. I only use result of cases.
I use Cases by Race, cases by age group, cases by sex.

From the link, there is data for only 3,752,800 cases, and 48% people responded for their race, 96% people responded for their age group, and 97% people responded for their sex.
So my final result can be biased. However, sample size is pretty big (which is more than 1,000,000) so I think my result having enough cases to prove which variable is the one that causes COVID19 cases most, so I predict that my result will be reasonable.
